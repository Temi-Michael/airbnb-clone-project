# airbnb-clone-project

This project is a full-stack clone of the Airbnb web application. The goal is to build a functional and responsive web app that allows users to browse, view, and book property listings.

## Learning Objectives

*   Implement responsive UI/UX designs from a mockup.
*   Structure a complex full-stack web application.
*   Practice component-based frontend architecture.
*   Follow best practices for web development, including version control and testing.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
*   **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
*   **Design Tools:** Figma

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Importance of Design Specifications

Identifying design properties like color palettes, typography, and spacing from a mockup is crucial for translating a design into a functional user interface. It ensures visual consistency with the designer's vision, maintains brand identity, and provides a predictable user experience. A detailed style guide extracted from the mockup is a single source of truth for developers, reducing ambiguity and accelerating development.

### Design Goals

*   **Intuitive Booking Flow:** A seamless and easy-to-follow process for users to book a property.
*   **Visual Consistency:** A consistent look and feel across the application.
*   **Performance:** Fast loading times for a better user experience.
*   **Responsiveness:** A mobile-first design that works on all screen sizes.

### Key Features

*   Property search and filtering
*   Detailed property viewing
*   Secure checkout process
*   User authentication

### Primary Pages

| Page                  | Description                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Property Listing View | A grid display of available properties with filters. |
| Detailed Listing View | Complete property details with images and booking form. |
| Checkout View         | A streamlined form for payment and booking confirmation. |

### Style Guide

#### Color Palette

*   **Primary:** `#FF5A5F`
